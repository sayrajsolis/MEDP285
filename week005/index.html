				<p>Your eye, <em>first of all,</em> <br> would <em>glide</em> over the grey fitted carpet in the

					the Derby winner Thunderbird, a paddle-steamer named <br><em>Ville-de-Motitereau</em>,<br> and a Stephenson locomotive, would lead to a leather curtain hanging on <br><strong>thick, black, grainy</strong><br> wooden rings which would <br><em>slide</em> back at the merest touch. <br>There, the carpet would give way to an almost yellow woodblock floor, <br>partly covered by three faded rugs.

					<p>It would be a living room about twenty-three feet long by ten feet wide. <br>On the left, in a  kind of recess, there would be a <h3>large</h3> sofa upholstered in worn <strong>black</strong> leather, with pale cherrywood bookcase on either side, </p>
				</div>
				<div class="grid-item-left">

			<br><br>
			Above the sofa, a mariner's chart would <strong>fill</strong> the whole length of that section of the wall. 
			<br>On the other side of a <h6>small</h6> low table, and beneath a silk prayer-mat nailed to the wall<br> with three large-headed brass studs, matching the leather curtain, there would be another sofa, at <br>r i g h t <br>a<br>n<br>g<br>l<br>e<br>s <br>to the first, with a light-brown velvet covering; it would lead on to a <br>small<br> and spindly piece of furniture, lacquered in dark red and providing <br>three <br>display <br>shelves for 
			<li>knick-knacks: 
			<li>agates and 
			<li>stone eggs, 
			<li>snuffboxes, 
			<li>candy-boxes, 
			<li>jade ashtrays, 
			<li>a mother-of-pearl oystershell, 
			<li>a silver fob watch, 
			<li>a cut-glass glass, 
			<li>a crystal pyramid, 
			<li>a miniature in an oval frame. 
			<br>Further on, beyond a padded door, there would be shelving on both sides of <br><br>the <br>cor<br>ner, <br>for 
			caskets and for records, beside a closed gramophone of which only four machined-steel knobs would be visible, and above it,a  print depicting <em>The Great Parade of the Military Tattoo.</em> 
			<br><br>


			<div id="green">
			<p>Through <br>the window, <br>draped with white <br>and brown curtains <br>in cloth imitating <br>Jouy wallpaper, you<br> would glimpse a<br> </p>
			</div>
			
			few <br>trees,<br> a tiny<br> park, <br>a bit<br> of street. 
			<br><br>

			A roll-top desk l i t t e r e d  with papers and pen-holders would go with a small cane-seated chair. 
			<br> On a console table would be 
			<li>a telephone, 
			<li>a leather diary, 
			<li>a writing pad. </li>
			<br>
			Then, on the other side of another door, beyond a low, square revolving bookcase supporting a <strong>large,</strong> cylindrical vase decorated in blue and <strong>filled</strong> with yellow roses, set beneath an oblong mirror in a mahogany frame, there would be a narrow table with its two benches upholstered in tartan, which would bring your eye back to the leather curtain.

			<br> It would be all in browns, ochres, duns and yellows: a world of slightly dull colours, in a carefully graded shades, calculated with almost too much artistry, in the midst of which would be some striking, brighter splashes <br>- a cushion in almost garish orange, a few multicoloured book jackets amongst the  leather-bound volumes. During the day, the light flooding in would make this room seem a little sad, despite the roses. It would be an evening room. But in the winter, with the curtains drawn, some spots illuminated - <br> the bookcase corner, the corner, the record shelves, the desk, the slow table between the two settees, and the vague reflections in the mirror -- and large expanses in shadow, whence all the things would gleam - the polished wood, the rich, heavy silks, the cut glass, the softened leather -- it would be a haven of peace, a land of happiness.
			<br><br> The first door would open onto a bedroom, its floor covered with a  <em>light</em>  -coloured fitted carpet. An English double bed would <strong>fill</strong> the whole rear part of it. On the right, to both sides of the window, there would be tall and narrow sets of shelves holding 
			<li>a few books, to be read and read again, 
			<li>photograph albums, 
			<li>packs of cards, 
			<li>pots, 
			<li>necklaces, 
			<li>paste jewelry.</li> 
			<br>
			To the left, an old oak wardrobe and two clothes horses of wood and brass would stand opposite a small wing-chair upholstered in thin-striped grey silk and a dressing table. Through a half-open door giving on to a bathroom you would glimpse 
			<br>
			<li><strong>thick</strong> bathrobes, 
			<li>swan-neck taps in <strong>solid</strong> brass, 
			<li>a large adjustable mirror.
			<li>A pair of <strong>cut-throat razors</strong> 
			<li>and their green leather sheaths, 
			<li>bottles, horn-handled brushes, 
			<li>sponges. </li>
		</p>
		<div class="grid-item-block">
			<p id="green">The bedroom walls would be papered with chintz; the bedspread would be a tartan blanket. A bedside table, with an openwork copper band running round three of its sides, would support a silver candlestick lamp topped with a very pale grey silk shade, a square carriage clock, a rose in a stem-vase, and, on its lower shelf, folded newspapers and some magazines. Further on, at the foot of the bed, there would be a big pouf in natural hide. At the window, the gauze curtains would slide on brass rods; the thick woollen double curtains would be half drawn. In the half-light the room would still be right. On the wall, above the bed made up and turned down for the night, between two small wall lamps, the astonishing, long, narrow black-and-white photograph of a bird in the sky would surprise you by its slightly formal perfection.</p>
			<p id="white">
			<br>The second door would reveal a study. From top to bottom the walls would be lined with books and periodicals with, here and there, so as to break the continuity of bindings and jackets, a number of prints, drawings and photographs - Antonello de Messina's Saint Jerome, a detail from The Triumph of Saint George, one of Piranesi's dungeons, a portrait by Ingres, a little pen-and-ink landscape by Klee, a sepia-tint photograph of Renan in his room at the College de France, a Steinberg department store, Cranach's Melanchthon - pinned to wooden panels set into the shelving. Slightly to the left of the window and at a shallow angle would be a long country table covered with a large red blotter. Wooden boxes, flat pen-holders and pots of all kinds would hold pencils, paper-clips, staples large and small. A glass tile would serve as an ashtray.</p>
			<p id="red">A circular black leather box decorated with gold-leaf arabesques would be filled with cigarettes. Light would come from an old desk-lamp, adjustable only with difficult, fitted with a green opaline lampshade shaped like a visor. On each side of the table, virtually facing each other, would be two high-backed wood and leather armchairs. Still further to the left, along the wall, would be a narrow table overflowing with books. A wing-chair in bottle-green leather would lead to grey metal filings cabinets and light wooden card-index boxes. On a third, even smaller table would be a Swedish lamp and a typewriter under its canvas dust-cover. Right at the back would be a narrow bed covered in ultramarine velvet and stacked with cushions of all colours. On a painted wooden stand, almost in the middle of the room, there would be a globe made of papier-mache and nickel silver, illustrated in naif style, a fake antique. Behind the desk, half-hidden by the red curtain at the window, would be an oiled-wood ladder which could slide on a brass rail all the way around the room.

			<p>There, life would be easy, simple. <br>
			All the servitudes, all the problems <br>
			brought by material existence would<br>
			find a natural solution. A cleaning lady<br>
			would come every morning. Every fortnight,<br>
			wine, oil and sugar would be delivered. There<br>
			would be a huge, bright kitchen with yellow arabe- <br>
			sques in metallic paint, cupboards everywhere, a hand<br>
			some whitewood table in the middle with stools and bench<br>
			seats. It would be pleasant to come and sit there, every morning,<br>
			after a shower, scarcely dressed. On the table there would be a<br>
			sizable stoneware butterdish, jars of marmalade, honey, toast,<br> 
			grapefruit cut in two. It would	be early. It would be May, the<br> 
			start of a long summer's day. They would open the mail, they <br>
			would open the newspapers. They would light their first cig-<br>
			arette. They would go out. Their work would keep them bu-<br>
			sy for a few hours only, in the morning. They would meet <br>
			for lunch, a sandwich or a steak, according to their moo-<br>
			d; they would have coffee at a street cafe and then go <br>
			home, on foot, slowly. Their flat would rarely be tidy, <br>
			 but its very untidiness would be its greatest charm.<br>
			 They would hardly bother themselves with it. They <br>
			 would live in it. The comfort of their surroun-<br>
			 dings would seem to them to be an established <br>
			 fact, a datum, a state of their nature. Their <br>
			 attention would be elsewhere: on the books <br>
			 they would open, on the text they would <br>
			 draft, on the record they would listen <br>
			 to, on their dialogue engaged afreshed <br>
			 each day. They would work for a long <br>
			 while. Then they would dine, or go <br>
			 out for dinner; they would see old <br>
			 friends; they would walk together.<br>
			Sometimes it would seem to them <br>that a whole life could be led harmoniously between these book-lined walls, amongst these objects so perfectly domesticated that they would have ended up believing these bright, soft, simple and beautiful things had only ever been made for their sole use. But they wouldn't feel enslaved by them: on some days, they would go off on a chance adventure. No plan seemed impossible to them. They would not know rancour, or bitterness, or envy. For their means and their desires would always match in all ways. They would call this balance happiness and, with their freedom, with their wisdom and their culture, they would know how to retain and reveal it in every moment of their living together.</p>
